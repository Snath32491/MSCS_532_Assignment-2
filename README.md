Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms: Quick Sort and Merge Sort

Overview

This project is part of *Assignment 2* for the course MSCS 532 Algorithm and Data Structures. It focuses on analyzing and implementing divide-and-conquer algorithms, specifically *Merge Sort* and *Quick Sort*. The project includes both theoretical analysis and practical implementation, with performance evaluation on different types of datasets.


Objectives

- Analyze the time complexity of Merge Sort and Quick Sort using asymptotic notation (O, Ω, Θ).
- Solve recurrence relations using substitution, recursion tree, and master method.
- Implement both algorithms in Python.
- Evaluate and compare performance across:
  - Sorted data
  - Reverse sorted data
  - Random data
- Visualize execution time and memory usage.
